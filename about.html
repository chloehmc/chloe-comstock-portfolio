          <h1>Hi, I'm Chloe</h1>
          <h3>Front-End Developer based in Amsterdam</h3>
          <p>
            With a background in psychology and behavioural science I've applied
            my knowledge to product design and development as a Product Owner
            and Product Manager. Now I practice what I preach as a Web Developer
            (HTML/CSS/JavaScript/Responsive design). Everything I have done,
            small or big, has been a vital stepping stone for where I am today.
          </p>
          <p>
            What excites me most about working in software development is being
            able to design and create things that have purpose and solve real
            problems. Leaning into customer research and insight, finding the
            right problems to solve, delivering that value as quickly as
            possible, learning from it and then iterating and improving that
            value over time is thmde key to great design.
